A rust implementation of [crosis](https://github.com/replit/crosis).

It is currently very bare-bones, containing only the code needed for simple projects.   Feel free to open an issue with any feature requests.

## Documentation
Documentation is currently a WIP.

The usage should hopefully feel similar to [crosis](https://github.com/replit/crosis).
